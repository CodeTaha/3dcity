# YouPower frontend
This is the frontend of the YouPower project.

## Setup
```
cd frontend/                                    # move into correct directory
npm install -g bower cordova ionic gulp         # install necessary tools for build
npm install                                     # install build dependencies
bower install                                   # install clientside dependencies
gulp                                            # builds frontend
ionic serve                                     # start web server
```

This will launch a preview of the application in your default web browser.
Running `ionic serve --lab` will simulate different mobile platforms for
testing.
