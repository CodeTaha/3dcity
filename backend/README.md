# YouPower backend

This is the backend of the YouPower app.

## Setup

First install `nodejs`, `npm`, `graphicsmagick` and `mongodb` on your local
machine.

If you're on Debian or Ubuntu, here's a hack to put nodejs into the same
path as other distros:
```
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

Then:
```
cd YouPower/    # move into project root
npm install     # install dependencies

# run server:
MONGO_URL=mongodb://user:pass@my.db/name npm start
```

If you're on a mac, then install and run MongoDB such: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ (otherwise see http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)

Then: 
```
# run server 
npm start
# or run server with automatic restart (with nodemon)
npm restart
```

## Running unit tests

Make sure that unit tests pass before pushing your code into the repository:
```
npm test
```
Note that this requires a local instance of mongodb running.

## Deploying

Code in the master branch is automatically built and tested by Travis CI.
Successful builds are automatically deployed into a free Heroku Sandbox (at
the moment) and will be available at: https://gentle-coast-9691.herokuapp.com/

## Notes on apidoc
The REST API documentation is generated from inline code comments following
the JSDoc specification. Here's apidoc specific information on the syntax:
http://apidocjs.com/

The documentation webpage is generated/updated by running `gulp apidoc`. (make
sure you have installed `gulp` globally). You will then be able to browse the
API documentation at http://localhost:3000

We will try to keep every single API path documented like this.

Current API documentation of latest master available here:

## Metrics
Most REST API calls are logged into the DB. The logs can be read using the
`metricsViewer.js` tool. It takes the following options:

    -c   Colorize output
    -e   Ellipsize long lines (only show first row)
    -h   Show help

Run it as

    node metricsViewer.js

It defaults to a local mongodb instance (named youpower), you can change this
by setting the `MONGO_URL` environment variable as such:

    MONGO_URL=mongodb://somewhere.else.com/youpower node metricsViewer.js

## Inserting default data into the database
When first launching the application it is pretty useless, since the database
is initially empty. In order to get started, populate it with some default
actions and communities using the `putDummyData.js` script.

Run it as

    node putDummyData.js

Just like the `metricsViewer.js` script, you can supply a custom MONGO_URL to
fill another database than the local one.
